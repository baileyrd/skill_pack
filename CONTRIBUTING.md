# Contributing

## Before you start
- Match surrounding conventions when editing existing code.
- Keep diffs focused — one logical change per PR.
- For large or hard-to-reverse changes (schema/data migrations, public API changes,
  deletions, dependency/toolchain bumps), open an issue or draft PR to discuss first.

## Workflow
1. Branch off the default branch.
2. Make your change. State the *why* in commit messages or PR description for any
   non-obvious decision.
3. Add tests for non-trivial logic — happy path and at least one failure/boundary case.
   Spikes/prototypes are exempt but should say so in the PR.
4. Add or update docstrings on any public surface you touched.
5. Open a PR — pick the template that matches (feature / bug fix / docs / chore).

## Code style
- Explicit over implicit; type hints/annotations always.
- Flat control flow — guard clauses, early returns, avoid >3 levels of nesting.
- Short, single-purpose functions.
- Minimal dependencies — justify any new third-party one in the PR description.
- Never commit or log secrets/credentials. Validate external input at the boundary.
- Never silently swallow exceptions — handle, propagate with context, or log.

## Review & merge
- Every change lands through a PR — no direct pushes to the default branch.
- CI must be green before merge.
- At least one approval required (see CODEOWNERS if present).
- Reviewers: check for scope creep, missing tests, and unexplained non-obvious decisions.
- Merge with a **merge commit** ("Create a merge commit" — merge and sync). Do **not**
  squash-merge or rebase-merge: full commit history is preserved deliberately.
